## Drop API
In order to relieve the load you simply publish the `latitude` and `longitude` of the point of delivery to the example as [here](https://github.com/simonpavlov/contracts/blob/master/drone_carrier.sol).
To perform additional actions may be modified `drop_cargo()` in [quad_controller.py](https://github.com/DroneEmployee/drone_employee_ros/blob/master/drone_employee/scripts/quad_controller.py).
